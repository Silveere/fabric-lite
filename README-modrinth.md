# Fabric Lite*

A "lightweight" vanilla-compatible modpack.

## Disclaimer

**TL;DR:** Check the rules of servers you play on. If they're really strict regarding mods, don't use this pack.

I make ***absolutely no guarantees*** as to whether this modpack fits within "legal" behavior for competitive multiplayer servers. Many servers are very strict as to how a user may modify their game, and certain mods may provide unfair advantages and/or modify the behavior of the game in a way that may violate server rules and result in a ban.

Additionally, this modpack is mainly made for myself and a few friends. You are free to use this modpack, but understand that my interest in Minecraft comes and goes, and as such, ongoing support is not guaranteed.

## Description

Fabric Lite* is a "lightweight" (50+ mods) vanilla-compatible modpack with optimization mods and sane defaults. It comes bundled with well-known mods, including Sodium, Iris, and Continuity. Mod-bundled resource packs, such as those required for Continuity to work, are enabled by default. It is configured with options for Minecraft as well as the bundled mods that are, IMHO, better than the default.

(The name "Fabric Lite*" is not set in stone. I might rename it to something like "YetAnotherFabricPack", to emphasize how original I am for making another OptiFine clone pack)

I mainly created this because I was unhappy with the myriad of other modpack choices, and I was sick of constantly recreating the same "modpack" in my launcher each time a new version came out, forgetting some mods, changing a bunch of settings, forgetting other settings, only to realize I forgot to download shaders.

Highlights include:
- Sodium
- Iris Shaders, with several shaders pre-bundled:
    - Rethinking Voxels
    - Complementary Reimagined
    - Complementary Shaders v4
    - BSL
    - MakeUp - Ultra Fast
    - VanillAA
- Figura (Custom Avatars)
- REI
- Xaero's Minimap, Xaero's World Map
- Inventory Profiles Next
    - Pre-bundled configuration with Vanilla-like defaults
- OptiFine Capes
- Various other performance mods
