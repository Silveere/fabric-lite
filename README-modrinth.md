# Fabric Lite*

A "lightweight" vanilla-compatible Optimization/QoL modpack.

## Disclaimer

This modpack includes mods that slightly alter the client behavior (e.g., Inventory Profiles Next), as well as mods that certain servers may deem unfair to Vanilla players (e.g., Xaero's Minimap). ***ALWAYS*** check the rules of servers you play on to make sure this is allowed, or you may risk a ban.

Additionally, this modpack is mainly made for myself and a few friends. You are free to use this modpack, but understand that my interest in Minecraft comes and goes, and as such, ongoing support is not guaranteed.

## Description

Fabric Lite* is a "lightweight" (50+ mods) vanilla-compatible modpack with optimization mods and sane defaults. It comes bundled with well-known mods, including Sodium, Iris, and Continuity. Built-in resource packs, such as the ones provided by Continuity, are enabled by default. The modpack changes a few options in both Vanilla Minecraft and the mods to provide a more streamlined experience.

I mainly created this because I was unhappy with the myriad of other modpack choices always missing some mod that I like, and I was sick of constantly recreating the same "modpack" in my launcher each time a new version came out, forgetting some mods, changing a bunch of settings, forgetting other settings, only to realize I forgot to download shaders.

Highlights include:
- Sodium
- Iris Shaders, with several shaders pre-bundled:
    - Rethinking Voxels
    - Complementary Reimagined
    - Complementary Shaders v4
    - BSL
    - MakeUp - Ultra Fast
    - VanillAA
- Figura (Custom Avatars)
- REI
- Xaero's Minimap, Xaero's World Map
- Inventory Profiles Next
    - Pre-bundled configuration with Vanilla-like defaults
- OptiFine Capes
- Various other performance mods
